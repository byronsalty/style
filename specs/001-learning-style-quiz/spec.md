# Feature Specification: Learning Style Quiz

**Feature Branch**: `001-learning-style-quiz`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a learning style quiz feature with 6 multiple-choice questions that determines one of 4 study styles (Visual Learner, Verbal Processor, Structured Planner, or Memorizer). The quiz should have an intro page, 6 questions with 4 options each (A-D), and a results page showing the user's study style with personalized tips."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Complete Quiz and Discover Learning Style (Priority: P1)

A prospective student visits the quiz to understand their learning style preferences and receive personalized study recommendations to help them prepare for exams more effectively.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - helping students identify how they learn best. Without this complete flow, the feature delivers no value.

**Independent Test**: User can navigate from intro page through all 6 questions, submit answers, and receive a personalized learning style result with actionable study tips. This can be tested end-to-end without any external dependencies.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a prospective student lands on the quiz intro page, **When** they read the introduction and click "Start Quiz", **Then** they see the first question with 4 answer options (A-D)

2. **Given** the user is viewing a quiz question, **When** they select one of the 4 options (A, B, C, or D), **Then** the selection is highlighted and they can proceed to the next question

3. **Given** the user has answered all 6 questions, **When** they submit their responses, **Then** their answers are evaluated and they are shown their primary learning style (Visual Learner, Verbal Processor, Structured Planner, or Memorizer)

4. **Given** the user receives their learning style result, **When** they view the results page, **Then** they see a description of their learning style plus 2-3 personalized study tips specific to that style

5. **Given** the user is on any question, **When** they want to change a previous answer, **Then** they can navigate back to previous questions and modify their selections

6. **Given** the user completes the quiz, **When** they view their results, **Then** the result is based on the most frequently selected learning style across their 6 answers (using tie-breaking if needed)

### User Story 2 - Retake Quiz (Priority: P2)

A user who has completed the quiz wants to retake it to see if their learning style has changed or to explore different answer combinations.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user engagement and allows users to validate their initial results or track changes over time. Not critical for initial value delivery but improves user experience.

**Independent Test**: User can click a "Retake Quiz" button from the results page, which clears their previous answers and returns them to the intro page to start fresh.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is viewing their quiz results, **When** they click "Retake Quiz", **Then** all previous answers are cleared and they return to the intro page

2. **Given** a user retakes the quiz, **When** they provide different answers, **Then** they receive a new result that may differ from their previous result

### User Story 3 - Save and Share Results (Priority: P3)

A user wants to save their quiz results or share them with others (study groups, mentors, or on social media).

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have feature that increases viral potential and allows users to reference their results later. Not essential for core value delivery.

**Independent Test**: User can save their results as a PDF or share via a unique link.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user views their quiz results, **When** they click "Save Results", **Then** their learning style and tips are saved (as PDF or printable format)

2. **Given** a user views their quiz results, **When** they click "Share", **Then** they receive a shareable link to their results page

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user closes the browser mid-quiz? (Assumption: Quiz progress is not saved; user starts over)
- How does the system handle ties (e.g., 2 learning styles each selected 3 times)? (Assumption: Use predefined priority order: Visual > Verbal > Structured > Memorizer, or show both styles)
- What happens if a user tries to submit the quiz without answering all questions? (Requirement: All questions must be answered before submission)
- Can users skip questions? (Assumption: No - all questions must be answered)
- What if a user refreshes the page during the quiz? (Assumption: Progress is lost unless session storage is implemented)
