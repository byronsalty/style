# Specification Quality Checklist: Learning Style Quiz

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Details**:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification is written entirely from a user perspective with no mention of frameworks (Phoenix, LiveView, Elixir) or technical implementation details. All sections focus on what users need and why.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers exist
   - All 12 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-012) are testable and specific
   - All 7 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-007) are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentages, device sizes)
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "under 2 minutes", "within 1 second", "375px width")
   - All user stories have complete acceptance scenarios using Given/When/Then format
   - Edge cases identified cover common scenarios (browser close, ties, incomplete submissions, refreshes)
   - Scope is clear: 6 questions, 4 learning styles, 3 pages (intro, questions, results)
   - Assumptions section explicitly documents decisions (no auth, no persistence, client-side calculation)

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
   - 3 user stories with clear priorities (P1: core quiz flow, P2: retake, P3: share)
   - User Story 1 is independently deliverable as MVP
   - Success criteria align with user stories (completion time, result display, navigation)
   - No implementation leakage detected

**Next Steps**: ✅ Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- MVP scope is clearly defined in User Story 1 (Priority P1)
- User Stories 2 and 3 can be deferred to later iterations
- All question content and result mappings are fully specified
- No ambiguities requiring clarification
